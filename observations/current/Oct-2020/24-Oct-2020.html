            <p style="font-size: 24px;">
                In the first half, after viewing the usual planets and the Moon and taking pictures, I tried 
                starhopping to M22, the globular star cluster in Sagittarius. I was able to locate a globular 
                cluster but couldn't confirm whether it was M22 because it was obstructed by the trees soon from 
                where I was using the telescope. <br><br>
                Next I tried to star hop to M57, the Ring Nebula in Lyra with little luck. No visual confirmation
                although I did see a smudge in between. Need to confirm with the positions of stars in a later viewing.
                <br><br>
                Later at night, after fixing the finder, I located the Pleadies str cluster, M45 with the finder. The finder
                is still a bit off though. I could easily locate larger/brighter objects like Mars, Moon and M45 with the finder.
                <br><br>
                Practiced star hopping near Perseus for a bit with the help of the Pocket Sky Atlas. I was able to confirm the 
                orientation of the map with respect to what I see in the eyepiece. Confirmed this with my drawings of the Pleadies as well.
                Objects in the eyepiece are just inverted - upside down. There is no mirroring taking place as I had doubted. So I can just
                hold the atlas upside down to get a direct representation of what I see through the eyepiece.
