            <p style="font-size: 24px;">The Orion Nebulae and a Rapidly Blinking Star?</p>

            <p style="font-size: 24px;">
               Observed Jupiter in the evening. Right now observing Orion. It is very cold. I observed the Orion Nebula near
               Orion's Belt. I observed Betelguese and Rigel. I also observed Sirius, the brightest star to the naked eye. I also
               saw a star blinking RAPIDLY somewhat near the horizon, or I will say, near a tree. I don't know what it is. I didn't have
               any star maps, the printer was not working properly. I don't think it is a star. The constellation of Orion has moved a lot
               since the last Orion observations on the 10th December entry. <br><br>
               The star which was blinking rapidly, I don't know what it is. Maybe its a comet? I had seen it a few days ago too, although I didn't 
               write about it. <br><br>
               The Orion Nebula seemed to be like a group of 3 stars with a patch of light around that area. I will try to observe it 
               more again tomorrow. Yesterday was also a Full Moon.
