            <h2 class="subtitle" style="color:#222831; font-size:40px;"> About Me</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;">
                I'm a 21 year old engineering undergraduate student who has been interested in astronomy from when I was
                in high school. I live in Kodanad, a village in Kerala, where I get Bortle 3-5 skies on a consistent basis.
                There was even lesser light pollution when I started astronomy, thanks to the lesser number of buildings
                back then. <br><br>
                I learnt many of the constellations with the help of printable planispheres from <a style="font-size: 24px; padding:0px;" href="http://skymaps.com/" target="_blank">skymaps.com</a>. 
                Most of the deep sky objects plotted in the map was out of my reach back then. The <a style="font-size: 24px; padding:0px;" href="https://skyandtelescope.org/" target="_blank">Sky and Telescope website</a>
                was also really useful to get to know current astronomical events and other such interesting information. 
                After a while of naked eye observations, I got myself a pair of binoculars, which instantly made stargazing a whole 
                lot more exciting, revealing more details in objects like the Moon and even some deep sky objects like the Orion Nebula. <br><br>
                I still remember the first time I saw the Pleiades cluster through my binoculars. I was so blown away by the amount of detail that the 
                small binoculars revealed. (It was later once I got a telescope did I realize that some objects look better at smaller magnifications). The 
                small patch of light in the sky that was the cluster, maybe resolvable by the naked eyes as a group of 4-5 stars forming a rhombus under dark skies
                immediately becomes evident as an open cluster of stars shining in a striking blue. This was one of the experiences that really 
                got me hooked into astronomy.
