                The sky wasn't clear even though the planets + several constellations were visible. Not to mention the light pollution. There was a 
                haze of light all over the sky. <br><br>
                At evening, I observed Jupiter and Saturn. Tried to get pictures of Saturn by taking a video of it, but this turned out to be unsuccssful. 
                <br><br>
                Later at night, tried to locate M2, but the hazy glowing sky made me quit. It was too bright to even see and identify the correct stars with the nake eye.
                I did focus the scope at a random star which I thought was Enif and was able to confirm it by the star patterns that I had drawn the other day which I still
                remembered! Really made clear to me why sketching down your observations can be really crucial and literally make you know the sky by heart. I had briefly observed Mars
                as well.  <br><br>
                PS - Realised that I can see more of Sagittarius than I had thought I could see. I should plan to spot the more brighter Messier objects there as well.
